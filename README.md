# ToDo List

This basic application showcases how you can leverage Alloy and Backbone Models to streamline your application development and simplify data storage and presentation using data binding within your apps.

## Key Focus / Learnings

* **Alloy Model Basics**
>Define / Adding / Updating and Deleting models using Alloy Backbone

* **Model-View Binding**
>Attaching an Alloy Model to View elements in order to reduce the overall code necessary to make updates to the view based on changes to the underlying data Model

* **Data Binding of Collections**
>Understand the concepts around binding multiple model elements of the same type, referenced as _Collections_, to specialized View based elements that are designed to hold larger amounts of data (aka. TableView, ListView, ScrollView, etc).

* **Synchronizing Alloy Models with Remote Datasources**
>Manage offline storage of content while allowing for remote storage with an existing datasource, allowing for content access from multiple datasources.
